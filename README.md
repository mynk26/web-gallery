# web-gallery

A smart web-based gallery which
make use of face_recognition (python lib.)
to help user in manage their photos.
All the photos with similar faces adds into
a single folder.
User can create new folder also.
All the basic options like move, copy, delete,
like and delete are implemented nicely.

User can also search photos by a face, i.e. he 
just needs to upload a photo with the face 
he want to search in his collection, and then 
all the linking logic avoid the the scanning of 
each photo and user gets the results as soon as 
a single time the face match.

Also a feature of delete suggestions is provided
which suggests those photos which are not opened
from last 150 days. 

It also provide a like options with each photo
and liked photos never appear in delete suggestions.

Copy, Move, Like, Delete and Download features
are also available foe MULTIPLE images.

Complete UI is responsive and in dark theme.
user can also see images side by side with thumbs,
or either in Full screen.

So. this is my mentor project for Vth SEM.
